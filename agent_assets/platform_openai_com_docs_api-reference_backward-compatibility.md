## Introduction

You can interact with the API through HTTP requests from any language, via our official Python bindings, our official Node.js library, or a [community-maintained library](/docs/libraries#community-libraries).

To install the official Python bindings, run the following command:

```bash
pip install openai
```

To install the official Node.js library, run the following command in your Node.js project directory:

```bash
npm install openai
```

## Authentication

### API keys

The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. You can create API keys at a user or service account level. Service accounts are tied to a "bot" individual and should be used to provision access for production systems. Each API key can be scoped to one of the following,

1. **Project keys** \- Provides access to a single project ( **preferred option**); access [Project API keys](/settings/organization/general) by selecting the specific project you wish to generate keys against.
2. **User keys** \- Our legacy keys. Provides access to all organizations and all projects that user has been added to; access [API Keys](/settings/organization/api-keys) to view your available keys. We highly advise transitioning to project keys for best security practices, although access via this method is currently still supported.

**Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

All API requests should include your API key in an `Authorization` HTTP header as follows:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Organizations and projects (optional)

For users who belong to multiple organizations or are accessing their projects through their legacy user API key, you can pass a header to specify which organization and project is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count as usage for the specified organization and project.

To access the `Default project` in an organization, leave out the `OpenAI-Project` header

Example curl command:

```bash
1
2
3
4
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Organization: YOUR_ORG_ID" \
  -H "OpenAI-Project: $PROJECT_ID"
```

Example with the `openai` Python package:

```python
1
2
3
4
5
6
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  organization='YOUR_ORG_ID',
  project='$PROJECT_ID',
)
```

Example with the `openai` Node.js package:

```javascript
1
2
3
4
5
6
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
    organization: "YOUR_ORG_ID",
    project: "$PROJECT_ID",
});
```

Organization IDs can be found on your [Organization settings](/settings/organization/general) page.
Project IDs can be found on your [General settings](/settings) page by selecting the specific project.

## Making requests

You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace `$OPENAI_API_KEY` with your secret API key. If you are using a legacy user key and you have multiple projects, you will also need to [specify the Project Id](/docs/api-reference/authentication). For improved security, we recommend transitioning to project based keys instead.

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
     "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.7
   }'
```

This request queries the `gpt-4o-mini` model (which under the hood points to a [`gpt-4o-mini` model variant](/docs/models#gpt-4o-mini)) to complete the text starting with a prompt of " _Say this is a test_". You should get a response back that resembles the following:

```json

{
    "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1677858242,
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 13,
        "completion_tokens": 7,
        "total_tokens": 20,
        "completion_tokens_details": {
            "reasoning_tokens": 0,
            "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0,
            "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0
        }
    },
    "choices": [\
        {\
            "message": {\
                "role": "assistant",\
                "content": "\n\nThis is a test!"\
            },\
            "logprobs": null,\
            "finish_reason": "stop",\
            "index": 0\
        }\
    ]
}
```

Now that you've generated your first chat completion, let's break down the [response object](/docs/api-reference/chat/object). We can see the `finish_reason` is `stop` which means the API returned the full chat completion generated by the model without running into any limits. In the choices list, we only generated a single message but you can set the `n` parameter to generate multiple messages choices.

## Streaming

The OpenAI API provides the ability to stream responses back to a client in order to allow partial results for certain requests. To achieve this, we follow the [Server-sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) standard. Our official [Node](https://github.com/openai/openai-node?tab=readme-ov-file#streaming-responses) and [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python?tab=readme-ov-file#streaming-responses) libraries include helpers to make parsing these events simpler.

Streaming is supported for both the [Chat Completions API](/docs/api-reference/chat/streaming) and the [Assistants API](/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun). This section focuses on how streaming works for Chat Completions. Learn more about how streaming works in the Assistants API [here](/docs/assistants/overview).

In Python, a streaming request looks like:

```python
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test"}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

In Node / Typescript, a streaming request looks like:

```javascript
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

async function main() {
    const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o-mini",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
        stream: true,
    });
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
        process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
    }
}

main();
```

#### Parsing Server-sent events

Parsing Server-sent events is non-trivial and should be done with caution. Simple strategies like splitting by a new line may result in parsing errors. We recommend using [existing client libraries](/docs/libraries) when possible.

## Debugging requests

In addition to [error codes](/docs/guides/error-codes) returned from API responses, it may sometimes be necessary to inspect HTTP response headers as well. Of particular interest will be the headers which contain the unique ID of a particular API request, and information about rate limiting applied to your requests. Below is an incomplete list of HTTP headers returned with API responses:

**API meta information**

- `openai-organization`: The [organization](/docs/guides/production-best-practices#setting-up-your-organization) associated with the request
- `openai-processing-ms`: Time taken processing your API request
- `openai-version`: REST API version used for this request (currently `2020-10-01`)
- `x-request-id`: Unique identifier for this API request (used in troubleshooting)

**[Rate limiting information](/docs/guides/rate-limits)**

- `x-ratelimit-limit-requests`
- `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-requests`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens`
- `x-ratelimit-reset-requests`
- `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens`

**OpenAI recommends logging request IDs in production deployments**, which will allow more efficient troubleshooting with our [support team](https://help.openai.com/en/) should the need arise. Our official SDKs provide a property on top level response objects containing the value of the `x-request-id` header.

**Request ID in Python**

```python
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{\
        "role": "user",\
        "content": "Say this is a test",\
    }],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)

print(response._request_id)
```

**Request ID in JavaScript**

```javascript
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
import OpenAI from 'openai';
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini'
});

console.log(response._request_id);
```

### Access raw response objects in SDKs

If you are using a lower-level HTTP client (like [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or [`HttpClient` in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/networking/http/httpclient)), you should already have access to response headers as a part of the HTTP interface.

If you are using one of OpenAI's [official SDKs](/docs/libraries) (which largely abstract the HTTP request/response cycle), you will need to access raw HTTP responses in a slightly different way.

Below is an example of accessing the raw response object (and the `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens` header) using our [Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python?tab=readme-ov-file#accessing-raw-response-data-eg-headers).

```python
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.with_raw_response.create(
    messages=[{\
        "role": "user",\
        "content": "Say this is a test",\
    }],
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)
print(response.headers.get('x-ratelimit-limit-tokens'))

# get the object that `chat.completions.create()` would have returned
completion = response.parse()
print(completion)
```

Here is how you'd access a raw response (and the `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens` header) using our [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node?tab=readme-ov-file#accessing-raw-response-data-eg-headers).

```javascript
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
import OpenAI from 'openai';
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini'
}).asResponse();

// access the underlying Response object
console.log(response.headers.get('x-ratelimit-limit-tokens'));
```

## Backward compatibility

OpenAI is committed to providing stability to API users by avoiding breaking changes in major API versions whenever reasonably possible. This includes:

- The REST API (currently `v1`)
- Our first-party [SDKs](/docs/libraries) (released SDKs will adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/))
- [Model](/docs/models) families (like `gpt-4o` or `o1-mini`)

Backwards-compatible changes and upgrades will be continuously delivered over time. These and any rare breaking changes will be communicated in the [changelog](/docs/changelog). Here are some examples of changes which we consider to be backwards-compatible (non-breaking) changes.

**Changes in model prompting behavior between snapshots**

Model outputs are by their nature variable, so changes in prompting and model behavior between snapshots should be expected. For example, if you moved from `gpt-4o-2024-05-13` to `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, the same `system` or `user` messages could function differently between versions. The best way to ensure consistent prompting behavior and model output is to use pinned model versions, and to implement [evals](/docs/guides/evals) for your applications.

**Backwards-compatible API changes**

- Adding new resources (URLs) to the REST API and SDKs
- Adding new optional API parameters
- Adding new properties to JSON response objects or event data
- Changing the order of properties in a JSON response object
- Changing the length or format of opaque strings, like resource identifiers and UUIDs
- Adding new event types (in either streaming or the Realtime API)

## Create transcription

posthttps://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions

Transcribes audio into the input language.

### Request body

file

file

Required

The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.

model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. Only `whisper-1` (which is powered by our open source Whisper V2 model) is currently available.

language

string

Optional

The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) format will improve accuracy and latency.

prompt

string

Optional

An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The [prompt](/docs/guides/speech-to-text#prompting) should match the audio language.

response\_format

string

Optional

Defaults to json

The format of the output, in one of these options: `json`, `text`, `srt`, `verbose_json`, or `vtt`.

temperature

number

Optional

Defaults to 0

The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use [log probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability) to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.

timestamp\_granularities\[\]

array

Optional

Defaults to segment

The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: `word`, or `segment`. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

### Returns

The [transcription object](/docs/api-reference/audio/json-object) or a [verbose transcription object](/docs/api-reference/audio/verbose-json-object).

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation)

logit\_bias

map

Optional

Defaults to null

Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

logprobs

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.

top\_logprobs

integer or null

Optional

An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

max\_tokens

Deprecated

integer or null

Optional

The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

This value is now deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`, and is not compatible with [o1 series models](/docs/guides/reasoning).

max\_completion\_tokens

integer or null

Optional

An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and [reasoning tokens](/docs/guides/reasoning).

n

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep `n` as `1` to minimize costs.

modalities

array or null

Optional

Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request.
Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:

`["text"]`

The `gpt-4o-audio-preview` model can also be used to [generate audio](/docs/guides/audio). To
request that this model generate both text and audio responses, you can
use:

`["text", "audio"]`

prediction

object

Optional

Configuration for a [Predicted Output](/docs/guides/predicted-outputs),
which can greatly improve response times when large parts of the model
response are known ahead of time. This is most common when you are
regenerating a file with only minor changes to most of the content.

Show possible types

audio

object or null

Optional

Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with
`modalities: ["audio"]`. [Learn more](/docs/guides/audio).

Show properties

presence\_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation)

response\_format

object

Optional

An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4o mini](/docs/models#gpt-4o-mini), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4) and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Show possible types

seed

integer or null

Optional

This feature is in Beta.
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.
Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

service\_tier

string or null

Optional

Defaults to auto

Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

- If set to 'auto', and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
- If set to 'auto', and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
- If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
- When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

When this parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` utilized.

stop

string / array / null

Optional

Defaults to null

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

stream

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

stream\_options

object or null

Optional

Defaults to null

Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

Show properties

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

top\_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

tools

array

Optional

A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

Show properties

tool\_choice

string or object

Optional

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message.
`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
`required` means the model must call one or more tools.
Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

`none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.

Show possible types

parallel\_tool\_calls

boolean

Optional

Defaults to true

Whether to enable [parallel function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling) during tool use.

user

string

Optional

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

function\_call

Deprecated

string or object

Optional

Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.
`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.
Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.

`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.

Show possible types

functions

Deprecated

array

Optional

Deprecated in favor of `tools`.

A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

Each Part can be at most 64 MB, and you can add Parts until you hit the Upload maximum of 8 GB.

It is possible to add multiple Parts in parallel. You can decide the intended order of the Parts when you [complete the Upload](/docs/api-reference/uploads/complete).

### Path parameters

upload\_id

string

Required

The ID of the Upload.

### Request body

data

file

Required

The chunk of bytes for this Part.

### Returns

You can specify the order of the Parts by passing in an ordered list of the Part IDs.

The number of bytes uploaded upon completion must match the number of bytes initially specified when creating the Upload object. No Parts may be added after an Upload is completed.

### Path parameters

upload\_id

string

Required

The ID of the Upload.

### Request body

part\_ids

array

Required

The ordered list of Part IDs.

md5

## Assistants  Beta

Build assistants that can call models and use tools to perform tasks.

[Get started with the Assistants API](/docs/assistants)

## Create assistant  Beta

posthttps://api.openai.com/v1/assistants

Create an assistant with a model and instructions.

### Request body

model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models) for descriptions of them.

name

string or null

Optional

The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

description

string or null

Optional

The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

instructions

string or null

Optional

The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.

tools

array

Optional

Defaults to \[\]

A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types `code_interpreter`, `file_search`, or `function`.

Show possible types

tool\_resources

object or null

Optional

A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the `code_interpreter` tool requires a list of file IDs, while the `file_search` tool requires a list of vector store IDs.

Show properties

metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top\_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

response\_format

"auto" or object

Optional

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Show possible types

### Returns

An [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants/object) object.

## List assistants  Beta

gethttps://api.openai.com/v1/assistants

Returns a list of assistants.

### Query parameters

limit

integer

Optional

Defaults to 20

A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20.

order

string

Optional

Defaults to desc

Sort order by the `created_at` timestamp of the objects. `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for descending order.

after

string

Optional

A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj\_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj\_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.

before

string

Optional

A cursor for use in pagination. `before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj\_foo, your subsequent call can include before=obj\_foo in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

## The assistant object  Beta

Represents an `assistant` that can call the model and use tools.

id

string

The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

object

string

The object type, which is always `assistant`.

created\_at

integer

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the assistant was created.

name

string or null

The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

description

string or null

The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

model

string

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models) for descriptions of them.

instructions

string or null

The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.

tools

array

A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types `code_interpreter`, `file_search`, or `function`.

Show possible types

tool\_resources

object or null

A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the `code_interpreter` tool requires a list of file IDs, while the `file_search` tool requires a list of vector store IDs.

Show properties

metadata

map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.

temperature

number or null

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top\_p

number or null

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

response\_format

"auto" or object

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

## Runs  Beta

Represents an execution run on a thread.

Related guide: [Assistants](/docs/assistants/overview)

## Create run  Beta

posthttps://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread\_id}/runs

Create a run.

### Path parameters

thread\_id

string

Required

The ID of the thread to run.

### Query parameters

include\[\]

array

Optional

A list of additional fields to include in the response. Currently the only supported value is `step_details.tool_calls[*].file_search.results[*].content` to fetch the file search result content.

See the [file search tool documentation](/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#customizing-file-search-settings) for more information.

### Request body

assistant\_id

string

Required

The ID of the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants) to use to execute this run.

model

string

Optional

The ID of the [Model](/docs/api-reference/models) to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.

instructions

string or null

Optional

Overrides the [instructions](/docs/api-reference/assistants/createAssistant) of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

additional\_instructions

string or null

Optional

Appends additional instructions at the end of the instructions for the run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis without overriding other instructions.

additional\_messages

array or null

Optional

Adds additional messages to the thread before creating the run.

Show properties

tools

array or null

Optional

Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

Show possible types

metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top\_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

stream

boolean or null

Optional

If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a `data: [DONE]` message.

max\_prompt\_tokens

integer or null

Optional

The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.

max\_completion\_tokens

integer or null

Optional

The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status `incomplete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.

truncation\_strategy

object

Optional

Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.

Show properties

tool\_choice

string or object

Optional

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
`auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
`required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user.
Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

Show possible types

parallel\_tool\_calls

boolean

Optional

Defaults to true

Whether to enable [parallel function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling) during tool use.

response\_format

"auto" or object

Optional

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Show possible types

### Returns

A [run](/docs/api-reference/runs/object) object.

Show properties

model

string

The model that the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants) used for this run.

instructions

string

The instructions that the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants) used for this run.

tools

array

The list of tools that the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants) used for this run.

Show possible types

metadata

map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maximum of 512 characters long.

usage

object or null

Usage statistics related to the run. This value will be `null` if the run is not in a terminal state (i.e. `in_progress`, `queued`, etc.).

Show properties

temperature

number or null

The sampling temperature used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.

top\_p

number or null

The nucleus sampling value used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.

max\_prompt\_tokens

integer or null

The maximum number of prompt tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

max\_completion\_tokens

integer or null

The maximum number of completion tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

truncation\_strategy

object

Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.

Show properties

tool\_choice

string or object

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
`auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
`required` means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user.
Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "file_search"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

Show possible types

parallel\_tool\_calls

boolean

Whether to enable [parallel function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling) during tool use.

response\_format

"auto" or object

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

## Streaming  Beta

Stream the result of executing a Run or resuming a Run after submitting tool outputs.
You can stream events from the [Create Thread and Run](/docs/api-reference/runs/createThreadAndRun),
[Create Run](/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun), and [Submit Tool Outputs](/docs/api-reference/runs/submitToolOutputs)
endpoints by passing `"stream": true`. The response will be a [Server-Sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) stream.
Our Node and Python SDKs provide helpful utilities to make streaming easy. Reference the
[Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn more.

## The message delta object  Beta

Represents a message delta i.e. any changed fields on a message during streaming.

id

string

The identifier of the message, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

object

string

The object type, which is always `thread.message.delta`.

delta

object

The delta containing the fields that have changed on the Message.

    ]
  }
}
```

## The run step delta object  Beta

Represents a run step delta i.e. any changed fields on a run step during streaming.

id

string

The identifier of the run step, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

object

string

The object type, which is always `thread.run.step.delta`.

        }\
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Assistant stream events  Beta

Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:

```text
event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
```

We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
`thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
`thread.message.completed` event.

We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to
integrate the Assistants API with streaming.

## Usage

The **Usage API** provides detailed insights into your activity across the OpenAI API. It also includes a separate [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs), which offers visibility into your spend, breaking down consumption by invoice line items and project IDs.

While the Usage API delivers granular usage data, it may not always reconcile perfectly with the Costs due to minor differences in how usage and spend are recorded. For financial purposes, we recommend using the [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs) or the [Costs tab](/settings/organization/usage) in the Usage Dashboard, which will reconcile back to your billing invoice.

## Realtime  Beta

Communicate with a GPT-4o class model live, in real time, over WebSocket.
Produces both audio and text transcriptions.
[Learn more about the Realtime API](/docs/guides/realtime).

## Client events

These are events that the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket server will accept from the client.

## session.update

Send this event to update the session’s default configuration. The client may
send this event at any time to update the session configuration, and any
field may be updated at any time, except for "voice". The server will respond
with a `session.updated` event that shows the full effective configuration.
Only fields that are present are updated, thus the correct way to clear a
field like "instructions" is to pass an empty string.

event\_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type

## input\_audio\_buffer.append

Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio
buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. In Server VAD
mode, the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide
when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer
manually.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum
of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the
VAD to be more responsive. Unlike made other client events, the server will
not send a confirmation response to this event.

event\_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.append`.

audio

string

Base64-encoded audio bytes. This must be in the format specified by the
`input_audio_format` field in the session configuration.

}
```

## input\_audio\_buffer.commit

Send this event to commit the user input audio buffer, which will create a
new user message item in the conversation. This event will produce an error
if the input audio buffer is empty. When in Server VAD mode, the client does
not need to send this event, the server will commit the audio buffer
automatically.

Committing the input audio buffer will trigger input audio transcription
(if enabled in session configuration), but it will not create a response
from the model. The server will respond with an `input_audio_buffer.committed`
event.

event\_id

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

## conversation.item.create

Add a new Item to the Conversation's context, including messages, function
calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a
"history" of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the
current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.

If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.created`
event, otherwise an `error` event will be sent.

event\_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type

string

The event type, must be `conversation.item.create`.

previous\_item\_id

string

The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted.
If not set, the new item will be appended to the end of the conversation.
If set, it allows an item to be inserted mid-conversation. If the ID
cannot be found, an error will be returned and the item will not be added.

## conversation.item.truncate

Send this event to truncate a previous assistant message’s audio. The server
will produce audio faster than realtime, so this event is useful when the user
interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not
yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with
the client's playback.

Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there
is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

If successful, the server will respond with a `conversation.item.truncated`
event.

event\_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type

string

The event type, must be `conversation.item.truncate`.

item\_id

string

The ID of the assistant message item to truncate. Only assistant message
items can be truncated.

content\_index

integer

The index of the content part to truncate. Set this to 0.

audio\_end\_ms

integer

Inclusive duration up to which audio is truncated, in milliseconds. If
the audio\_end\_ms is greater than the actual audio duration, the server
will respond with an error.

}
```

## conversation.item.delete

Send this event when you want to remove any item from the conversation
history. The server will respond with a `conversation.item.deleted` event,
unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the
server will respond with an error.

event\_id

string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type

## response.create

This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering
model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses
automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case
the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the
conversation history.

The server will respond with a `response.created` event, events for Items
and content created, and finally a `response.done` event to indicate the
Response is complete.

The `response.create` event includes inference configuration like
`instructions`, and `temperature`. These fields will override the Session's
configuration for this Response only.

## conversation.item.created

Returned when a conversation item is created. There are several scenarios that
produce this event:

- The server is generating a Response, which if successful will produce
either one or two Items, which will be of type `message`
(role `assistant`) or type `function_call`.
- The input audio buffer has been committed, either by the client or the
server (in `server_vad` mode). The server will take the content of the
input audio buffer and add it to a new user message Item.
- The client has sent a `conversation.item.create` event to add a new Item
to the Conversation.

## conversation.item.input\_audio\_transcription.completed

This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the
user audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is
committed by the client or server (in `server_vad` mode). Transcription runs
asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after
the Response events.

Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a
separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model,
currently always `whisper-1`. Thus the transcript may diverge somewhat from
the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

## conversation.item.truncated

Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the
client with a `conversation.item.truncate` event. This event is used to
synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

This action will truncate the audio and remove the server-side text transcript

## conversation.item.deleted

Returned when an item in the conversation is deleted by the client with a
`conversation.item.delete` event. This event is used to synchronize the
server's understanding of the conversation history with the client's view.

event\_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.

type

string

The event type, must be `conversation.item.deleted`.

## input\_audio\_buffer.committed

Returned when an input audio buffer is committed, either by the client or
automatically in server VAD mode. The `item_id` property is the ID of the user
message item that will be created, thus a `conversation.item.created` event
will also be sent to the client.

event\_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.

type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.committed`.

previous\_item\_id

## input\_audio\_buffer.speech\_started

Sent by the server when in `server_vad` mode to indicate that speech has been
detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the
buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this
event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

The client should expect to receive a `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` event
when speech stops. The `item_id` property is the ID of the user message item
that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the
`input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` event (unless the client manually commits
the audio buffer during VAD activation).

event\_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.

type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`.

audio\_start\_ms

integer

Milliseconds from the start of all audio written to the buffer during the
session when speech was first detected. This will correspond to the
beginning of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the
`prefix_padding_ms` configured in the Session.

item\_id

string

The ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops.

```

## input\_audio\_buffer.speech\_stopped

Returned in `server_vad` mode when the server detects the end of speech in
the audio buffer. The server will also send an `conversation.item.created`
event with the user message item that is created from the audio buffer.

event\_id

string

The unique ID of the server event.

type

string

The event type, must be `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped`.

audio\_end\_ms

integer

Milliseconds since the session started when speech stopped. This will
correspond to the end of audio sent to the model, and thus includes the
`min_silence_duration_ms` configured in the Session.

## Completions  Legacy

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions along with the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position. Most developer should use our [Chat Completions API](/docs/guides/text-generation#text-generation-models) to leverage our best and newest models.

## Create completion  Legacy

posthttps://api.openai.com/v1/completions

Creates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters.

### Request body

model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models) for descriptions of them.

prompt

string or array

Required

The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

Note that <\|endoftext\|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.

best\_of

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return – `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

echo

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion

frequency\_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation)

logit\_bias

map

Optional

Defaults to null

Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <\|endoftext\|> token from being generated.

logprobs

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to null

Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.

max\_tokens

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 16

The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the completion.

The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens.

n

integer or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

How many completions to generate for each prompt.

**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

presence\_penalty

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation)

seed

integer or null

Optional

If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.

Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

stop

string / array / null

Optional

Defaults to null

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

stream

boolean or null

Optional

Defaults to false

Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

stream\_options

object or null

Optional

Defaults to null

Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.

Show properties

suffix

string or null

Optional

Defaults to null

The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

This parameter is only supported for `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`.

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

top\_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

user

string

Optional

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).

### Returns

Returns a [completion](/docs/api-reference/completions/object) object, or a sequence of completion objects if the request is streamed.

## Assistants (v1)  Legacy

Build assistants that can call models and use tools to perform tasks.

[Get started with the Assistants API](/docs/assistants)

## Create assistant (v1)  Legacy

posthttps://api.openai.com/v1/assistants

Create an assistant with a model and instructions.

### Request body

model

string

Required

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models#overview) for descriptions of them. type: string

name

string or null

Optional

The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

description

string or null

Optional

The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

instructions

string or null

Optional

The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.

tools

array

Optional

Defaults to \[\]

A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types `code_interpreter`, `retrieval`, or `function`.

Show possible types

file\_ids

array

Optional

Defaults to \[\]

A list of [file](/docs/api-reference/files) IDs attached to this assistant. There can be a maximum of 20 files attached to the assistant. Files are ordered by their creation date in ascending order.

metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top\_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

response\_format

string or object

Optional

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

### Returns

An [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants-v1/object) object.

## Modify assistant (v1)  Legacy

posthttps://api.openai.com/v1/assistants/{assistant\_id}

Modifies an assistant.

### Path parameters

assistant\_id

string

Required

The ID of the assistant to modify.

### Request body

model

Optional

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models#overview) for descriptions of them. type: string

name

string or null

Optional

The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

description

string or null

Optional

The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

instructions

string or null

Optional

The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.

tools

array

Optional

Defaults to \[\]

A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types `code_interpreter`, `retrieval`, or `function`.

Show possible types

file\_ids

array

Optional

Defaults to \[\]

A list of [File](/docs/api-reference/files) IDs attached to this assistant. There can be a maximum of 20 files attached to the assistant. Files are ordered by their creation date in ascending order. If a file was previously attached to the list but does not show up in the list, it will be deleted from the assistant.

metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top\_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

response\_format

string or object

Optional

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

### Returns

The modified [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants-v1/object) object.

posthttps://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread\_id}/runs

Create a run.

### Path parameters

thread\_id

string

Required

The ID of the thread to run.

### Request body

assistant\_id

string

Required

The ID of the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants-v1) to use to execute this run.

model

string

Optional

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top\_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

stream

boolean or null

Optional

If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a `data: [DONE]` message.

max\_prompt\_tokens

integer or null

Optional

The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status `complete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.

max\_completion\_tokens

integer or null

Optional

The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status `complete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.

truncation\_strategy

object

Optional

Show properties

tool\_choice

string or object

Optional

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
`auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool.
Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "TOOL_TYPE"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

Show possible types

response\_format

string or object

Optional

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

### Returns

A [run](/docs/api-reference/runs-v1/object) object.

## Create thread and run (v1)  Legacy

posthttps://api.openai.com/v1/threads/runs

Create a thread and run it in one request.

### Request body

assistant\_id

string

Required

The ID of the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants-v1) to use to execute this run.

thread

object

Optional

Show properties

model

string

Optional

The ID of the [Model](/docs/api-reference/models) to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.

instructions

string or null

Optional

Override the default system message of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

tools

array or null

Optional

Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

metadata

map

Optional

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top\_p

number or null

Optional

Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

stream

boolean or null

Optional

If `true`, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a `data: [DONE]` message.

max\_prompt\_tokens

integer or null

Optional

The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status `complete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.

max\_completion\_tokens

integer or null

Optional

The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status `complete`. See `incomplete_details` for more info.

truncation\_strategy

object

Optional

Show properties

tool\_choice

string or object

Optional

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
`auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool.
Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "TOOL_TYPE"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

Show possible types

response\_format

string or object

Optional

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request.

## The run object (v1)  Legacy

Represents an execution run on a [thread](/docs/api-reference/threads-v1).

id

string

The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

object

string

The object type, which is always `thread.run`.

created\_at

integer

string

The ID of the [thread](/docs/api-reference/threads-v1) that was executed on as a part of this run.

assistant\_id

string

The ID of the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants-v1) used for execution of this run.

status

string

The status of the run, which can be either `queued`, `in_progress`, `requires_action`, `cancelling`, `cancelled`, `failed`, `completed`, or `expired`.

required\_action

object or null

Details on the action required to continue the run. Will be `null` if no action is required.

Show properties

last\_error

object or null

The last error associated with this run. Will be `null` if there are no errors.

Show properties

expires\_at

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run will expire.

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was started.

cancelled\_at

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was cancelled.

failed\_at

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run failed.

completed\_at

integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was completed.

incomplete\_details

object or null

Details on why the run is incomplete. Will be `null` if the run is not incomplete.

Show properties

model

string

The model that the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants-v1) used for this run.

instructions

string

The instructions that the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants-v1) used for this run.

tools

array

The list of tools that the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants-v1) used for this run.

Show possible types

file\_ids

array

The list of [File](/docs/api-reference/files) IDs the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants-v1) used for this run.

metadata

map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

usage

temperature

number or null

The sampling temperature used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.

top\_p

number or null

The nucleus sampling value used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.

max\_prompt\_tokens

integer or null

The maximum number of prompt tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

max\_completion\_tokens

integer or null

The maximum number of completion tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

truncation\_strategy

object

Show properties

tool\_choice

string or object

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message.
`auto` is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool.
Specifying a particular tool like `{"type": "TOOL_TYPE"}` or `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.

Show possible types

response\_format

string or object

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

**Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

## Streaming (v1)  Legacy

Stream the result of executing a Run or resuming a Run after submitting tool outputs.

You can stream events from the [Create Thread and Run](/docs/api-reference/runs-v1/createThreadAndRun),
[Create Run](/docs/api-reference/runs-v1/createRun), and [Submit Tool Outputs](/docs/api-reference/runs-v1/submitToolOutputs)
endpoints by passing `"stream": true`. The response will be a [Server-Sent events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#server-sent-events) stream.

Our Node and Python SDKs provide helpful utilities to make streaming easy. Reference the
[Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn more.

## The message delta object (v1)  Legacy

Represents a message delta i.e. any changed fields on a message during streaming.

id

string

The identifier of the message, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

object

string

The object type, which is always `thread.message.delta`.

delta

object

The delta containing the fields that have changed on the Message.

        "text": { "value": "Hello", "annotations": [] }\
      }\
    ]
  }
}
```

## The run step delta object (v1)  Legacy

Represents a run step delta i.e. any changed fields on a run step during streaming.

id

string

The identifier of the run step, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

object

string

The object type, which is always `thread.run.step.delta`.

delta

object

The delta containing the fields that have changed on the run step.

        }\
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Assistant stream events (v1)  Legacy

Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:

```text
event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
```

We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
`thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
`thread.message.completed` event.

We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to
integrate the Assistants API with streaming.
