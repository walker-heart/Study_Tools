	•	Immediate Correction: Users can swiftly identify and rectify mistakes, reinforcing correct memorization.
	•	Motivation: Positive reinforcement through green indicators boosts user morale and encourages continued practice.

b. Caret Functionality (Caret Management)

The caret, commonly known as the text cursor, plays a crucial role in the user interaction within the Memorization Software:
	•	Automatic Focus: Upon entering the game page, the caret is automatically focused in the hidden input field, ensuring that the user can start typing immediately without additional clicks.
	•	Visibility and Control: Although the input field is hidden, the caret’s position is managed programmatically to synchronize with the displayed text in the typing area. This seamless integration maintains the illusion of a direct typing experience.
	•	Navigation Support: Users can navigate through the text using keyboard shortcuts (e.g., arrow keys), with the caret reflecting their current position. This functionality aids in precise memorization and review.

Benefits:
	•	Streamlined Typing Experience: Users can concentrate on typing without being distracted by the actual input field.
	•	Synchronization: The caret’s position aligns with the displayed text, ensuring accurate tracking of user input.
	•	Enhanced Usability: Automatic focus management simplifies the user interface, making the tool more intuitive.
